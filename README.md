This repository contains the source code for a classic Tetris game built using JavaScript. The game features the iconic gameplay of Tetris, where players manipulate falling tetrominoes to create complete lines and clear them from the screen.

## Features

- Tetrominoes: The game includes various tetromino shapes, such as L-shape, T-shape, and square shape, that fall from the top of the screen. Players can rotate and move these tetrominoes horizontally to fit them into the existing blocks on the screen.
- Complete lines: When players fill an entire row with blocks, that line is cleared, and the player earns points. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each line cleared.
- Speed and difficulty levels: The game starts with a slow falling speed of tetrominoes, but as the game progresses, the falling speed increases, making the game more challenging.
- Game over and restart: The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen, and the player loses. The game provides an option to restart and play again.
- Keyboard controls: The game allows players to control the tetrominoes using keyboard inputs, such as moving left, right, down, and rotating them.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The game is built using JavaScript, a popular programming language for web development.
- HTML/CSS: The game uses HTML and CSS for rendering the game screen and styling.
- DOM manipulation: The game utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the HTML elements on the web page for updating the game state and rendering the game screen.
- Event handling: The game includes event listeners to handle keyboard inputs and update the game state accordingly.
- Game loop: The game implements a game loop, which is a continuous loop that handles game updates, rendering, and input processing.
